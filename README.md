## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- See the correct content for the Family Gatherings, Special Events, and Social Events section when the user clicks each tab
- Receive an error message when the booking form is submitted if:
  - The `Name` or `Email Address` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
  - Any of the `Pick a date` or `Pick a time` fields are empty should show "This field is incomplete"
  - The `month` and `date` that is picked in not in the past and if it is should show "Date must be in future"
  - The `year` can only be the current year or one year in the future
- The number of people in reservation able to be increased and decreased:
  - The amount of people does not go below 0 or above 30
  - When the user tries to increase to more than 30 people the number does not go up past 30 and an error message says "Sorry we can not accommodate parties larger than 30"

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

I learn more about JavaScript and form validation with this project.

### Continued development

I am going to keep learning more about form validation and using Javascript with forms. I had fun creating this project and seeing it come together. It was interesting seeing the form working the way the website plan wanted and adding for functionality so a past date can not be selected.

I had fun creating this project and am looking forward to learning even more from the next project I create!
